# Chapter 1: Putting Asp.Net Core in Context

Asp.Net Core is Microsoft's web development platform. The original Asp.Net was released in 2002 and went through several transformations to become Asp.Net Core 6, which is what this book is about. The structure of Asp.Net Core is illustrated by Figure 1-1.

## Understanding the application frameworks

Getting start with Asp.Net Core can be confusing, there are many different frameworks available. These frameworks are complementary and solve different problems or solve the same problems in different ways. It is very important to understand the relationship between these frameworks, which will be covered in the next sections

### Understanding the MVC Framework

The MVC Framework was introduced at the beginning of **ASP.NET**, long before **.NET Core** and **.NET 6** were introduced. The original ASP.NET started with the *Web Page* development model, which consisted of writing desktop applications that resulted in web projects. The MVC Framework was introduced along with Web Pages, but with one difference, the MVC Framework explicitly uses HTTP and HTML.
